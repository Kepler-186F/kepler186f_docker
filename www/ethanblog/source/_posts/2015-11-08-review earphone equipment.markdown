So why a audiophile?

As a person watching computer screen all day, researching audio equipment (earphone headphone) is one of only few hobbies that I have. The invest on them are easily proven to be cost-efficent: I listen to them while I use computer, which is pretty much all day along. Anyways, it's been 5 years since I stepped on this once-step-in-no-step-back hi-fi journey. I decided to write something to wrap them up and give beginners some advices.


So why earphone?

As a way of enjoying sound, first off you have some options. You may go one of these three: speakers(those loud speaker boxes), headphones or earphones. First speaker is no brainer not an option for me, they are heavy to move and I can't use them in office. Headphones are also bad because some open back ones leaks sound pretty bad which I also can not use in office. Ideally the one I'm looking for is something supper low-profile and not compromising hi-fidelity at the same time.


Journey of Sennheiser CX300

My journey starts from Sennheiser CX300, an earphone that designed for entry-level users. Even though my first CX300 turn out to be not an authentic one from Sennheiser, but it sounded just amazing, as I have no other to compare, and it opened a door for me to this aspiring hi-fidelity world. That one costs me about 40 bucks, and it was just amazing. My big impression were isolation and great surrounding feeling. Never before has a earphone feels so comfortable and so sound-isolating that after wearing it for a while, you magically feel the sound volume somehow gets turned up. Surrounding feeling of this thing is also impressive, due to the great isolation.

->for beginners: In general at this price range(Less than $50), you are expecting some major improvement compare to apple's earbuds. The ecstasy of trance begin to appear, and you will find yourself quite enjoying from the repetition of those trances in a music.

It is still in general horrible, for pretty much all earphones at this range, to handle classics or jazz. But for popular music and some vocals, this range is a great start. Recommend: Xiaomi Piston 2.



Journey of Sennheiser IE6

When I was still at Iowa doing my college program, one day at Cyber Monday I saw Sennheiser IE6 was list as a lighting-deal, pricing at $99. Therefore that becomes my second milestone on earphones. I have used IE 6 for about 2 years straight. Hands down great earphones. I would've continue use then if not there cable finally worn out and I failed to fix them after couple tries. IE is a class that designed for audiophiles, and IE6 is an entry-level of that class.

->for beginners: At this price range ($50 - $200), there are a bunch of great earphones or headphones that are available. You will feel they are significantly 1 to 2 level better than the previous price range, specially when comes down to fidelity and balance. They are considered 'sub-flagships' and is in my view the most cost-efficent price range to stay on.  However compare to the flagships(IE 8, SE535, EX1000 etc), they more or less has one or two flaws regarding bass, mid-range or treble.

At this point they usually handle great popular music. Some maybe good at one particular genre than others, e.g. vocals. Still, struggling at classics and jazz. Recommend: SE215, Sennheiser Momentum InEar.




Journey of Shure SE535

Then comes SE535. In a word, I regret having bought it. Unlike my every other upgrades, which I usually felt satisfying and sense of accomplishments afterwards, the purchase of SE535 however is a disaster. She impressed me by a lot at first, then it left me craving for more. First, SE535 has a great fidelity, which means lots of details. It enables me to notice many more details that I wasn't aware of even in a song that I was looping all day long. However the killer of SE535 was her mid-range. Those 'pure liquid gold' was just incredible. This earphone made me think, the ultimate goal of audiophile, rather than to pursue those hard specs, is to 'find yourself being moved'. When Tori Kelly was singing Colors of the wind, or when V.K was in the middle performing his piano solo Reflection, SE535 inspired me that, after all, at its core, the music is an art of expressing feelings. And to accomplish this connection between listener and performer you will have to also involve your imagination.....SE535 not only precisely captures the music structures and every other details, it blends them all in, like reading a poem or telling a story. It forces me to ignore those individual instruments, but to focus on performer's enthusiasm that deep inside.

Now, everything else about SE535 is depressing. Specially when comes down to sound stage. The bass and treble is just OMG bad.

->for beginners: At this price range($200 - $600), you will have to do a major study regarding the genre you usually listen to. There are SE535, IE 8, TF 10, Sony EX1000 and ATH CK100 etc. My recommendation is Westone W4R.
